            <p>A trip around Scotland with Rocket. Up the west coast to Loch Lomand, Fort William, into the
                highlands, a brief visit to Isle of Skye and across to the east before a long day ride back from Dundee
                to the ferry in
                Cairnryan.
                Weather was fantastic throughout. Such amazing roads to ride with amazing scenery!

                    An early morning rise at 4am. Bike packed up and last minute safety checks on the bike and on the
                    road at 6am. Foggy ride along the Antrim Coast Road to Larne to catch the 8.30 P+O Ferry to
                    Cairnryan.
                    Smooth sailing and a healthy fry up on the Ferry so we were ready to ride as soon as soon we got off
                    the Ferry. As we had done in a previous trip we decided to follow the coast as much as we could.
                    A lunch stop in Preswick for a rest and a bite to eat. Next we rode up to Glasgow and Rocket got us
                    lost going through the city but wouldn't admit to being lost until we had rode around in circles for
                    at least an hour.
                    After a quick stop to get the map out and figure out how best to get out of the city, we were on our
                    way again.
                    I think in future we will avoid the city and stay on tyhe coast to go around Greenock. After getting
                    out of the city we proceeded along the coast again.
                    A great relaxing spin up to Loch Lomand. As it was getting late we didn't do as much exploring
                    around Loch Lomand as we did the previous year and opted to get to our first days campsite.
                    We stayed in <a href="https://www.beinglascampsite.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beinglas
                    Farm Campsite</a>. The facilities here were excellent and I would highly recommend a stay if you
                    are in the area.
                    Prebooking is advised during the summer months as places fill up very quickly.

                    After a good nights rest we were on the road again by 8am. A nice relaxed ride through the mountains. Plenty of stops to take some pictures of the stuning scenery.
                    Arrived in Fort William around lunchtime. Bikes parked up we went exploring around the town. A bite to eat in Witherspoons and on the road again. 
                    Next we opted for a bit of touring around Glenfinnan, Lochailort, Accharacle, Corran. Small roads for the most part but reasonable surface with a few wider roads heading downhill again with long sweeping bends. A bikers dream and definitely brought a smile to my face. 
                    That evening we headed back to Fort William, took a little spin out to look at Ben Nevis and bunked down in 
                    <a href="https://www.braemarholidays.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Braemar Guesthouse</a> which was nice although a little noisey with the sound of people walking upstairs heard in our room.

                    A little later on the road today and an hour on the road and disater struck! My chain snapped cruising along at 60mph. 
                    Luckily it got spat straight out the back of the bike and didn't get tangled in the wheel otherwise I might not have been here to tell the tale. Unfortuneately that was where the luck ended. On inspection of the damage I discovered that in the process of flinkging off, the chain had snapped the clutch pin on it way out. 
                    As we still had a few days left on the trip we were feeling a bit anxious at the stage as to whether we could get it on the road again. After ringing around several garages we fou d somewhere that stocked the chain I needed but nowhere could get a clutch pin until Monday wheich would have sost us 2 days of the trip. 
                    we finally got talking to an old biker who came up with a solution of cutting the head of a bolt and sloting into tyhe clutch to replace the pin. After a very scary run on the back of Rockets bike we got the bolt and a replacement chain in Inverness. 
                    Soon after we were on the road again. We headed towards Isle of Skye. Unfortunately because of the earlier misfortunes it was getting late. We had to forgo the full tour around the island that we had planned and went straight to 
                    <a href="https://kinloch-campsite.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kinlough Campsite</a> and the tents up for the evening. This site is in a stunning location and the facilites were excelent.

            <p>My first trip to Scotland on the bike. We didn't really have a plan other than to turn left when we got off the ferry at Cairnryan. Weather was good and the roads dry. Short trip of only 3 days but we made the most of it and I still managed to clock up over 1200 miles. Long days in the saddle but didn't feel that way since the roads were so enjoyable to ride. 
                I especially enjoyed the winding roads through the valleys with beautiful mountains and forests on either side. 3 days just made me long for more so maybe a longer trip will be planned for the next visit.

                <p>We got the 10am Ferry to Cairnryan and were heading up the west coast of Scotland by lunchtime. Weather was clear and the roads fairly quiet. 
                    We spent most of the day exploring and enjoring the amazing coast roads and ended up in Loch Lomand. Unfortunately we hadn't preboked any accomadation so we did struggle to find a campsite. 
                    Quiet a few we tried were either booked out or didn't allow tents to be pitched. Eventually we settled in 
                    <a href="https://www.campingandcaravanningclub.co.uk/campsites/uk/glasgow/drymen/milarrochy-bay-camping-and-caravanning-club-site/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_content=MilarrochyBay&utm_campaign=google_places" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milarrochy Bay Campsite</a>
                     located right on the shores of Loch Lomand. Would be a perfect base for someone who likes Kayaking with direct access onto the loch from the campsite.

                    Headed north first thing in the morning and through the mist covered mountains. The mist soon cleared and we wound through the mountains on brilliant roads that seemed to give us endless corners through the glens surrounded by forest.
                    As evening approached we headed back south again with a stop in Inverarray for a rest and then followed the coastline to Lochgilphead. 
                    We had planned to do some wild camping around this area but after a couple of hours of aimlessly trying to find a spot we settled on just pitching up in 
                     <a href="https://www.lochgilpheadcaravanpark.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lochgilphead Caravan Park</a> which normally doesn't take tents but luckily manager is a biker too and found us a spot to bed down for the night. 
                     The facilities here were spotless and the only fault I had was the water for the showers were cold at 7.30am.

                    A very early start to the day. 6am rise and a cold shower. On the road for 7.30am and back through Inverarray. We spent the morning enjoying some of the mountain roads on a different route back through Cairndow which again boasted well maintained roads with splendid views. 
                    Lunchtime saw us in Glasgow where we stopped for lunch. After our bellys were full we meadered down the coast again to catch the Ferry in Cairnryan. 
                    Off the ferry and a long ride back home to Donegal on my own to end a great weekend away. I will definitely be planning for another trip to Scotland in the near future.
